# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ho Kim, and I like Rust!

I'm working on my Ph.D in [NetAI (Networked Artificial Intelligence Lab, GIST, South Korea)](https://netai.smartx.kr/).

I'm a founder of [UlagBulag Village](https://ulagbulag.io/), which defines and pioneers **[`Cloud-native Desktop Environment`](https://github.com/ulagbulag/OpenARK)**.

I am also a research director of [Clondstone](https://cloudstone.ai/). Here, I develop and share technologies such as Food Concierge, Vehicle Route Optimization, Delivery Robot Control in City, and AI Market Analysis.
