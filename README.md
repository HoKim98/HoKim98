# ðŸ’– Hello World ðŸ¤­

I'm Ho Kim.
I'm working on my Ph.D in [NetAI (Networked Artificial Intelligence Lab, GIST, South Korea)](https://netai.smartx.kr/).

I'm a CEO of [UlagBulag Village](https://ulagbulag.io/), which defines and pioneers **[`Cloud-native Desktop Environment`](https://github.com/ulagbulag/OpenARK)**.

I'm an CAIO of [Clondstone](https://cloudstone.ai/). Here, I develop and share technologies such as Food Concierge, Vehicle Route Optimization, Delivery Robot Control in City, and AI Market Analysis.

## My Focus

My main focus right now is building a Cloud-native Desktop Environment.

* MobileX: I automatically install and manage the necessary programs so that students can easily practice AI and IoT at educational sites such as schools.
* X+AI: I am researching convenient interaction methods so that I can enjoy the optimal HPC environment to utilize AI anytime, anywhere.
* 
* Storage: I want to keep my and my customers' data safe from accidents and mishandling. So I'm working on a convenient way to configure and deploy a storage network relationship for data backup and recovery.
* Management Tool: I am developing an integrated control system that encompasses rack mounting, K8S configuration, and organization.
